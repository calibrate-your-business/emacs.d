* DONE OrgMode Examples - Emphasis and Code
You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and ~code~, and, if you must, +strike-through+.
** I have customized ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ to ~true~ to avoid this look:
#+begin_src orgmode
When you show markers, it can get kinda ugly: *bold*, /italic/,
 _underlined_, =verbatim= and ~code~, and +strike-through+.
#+end_src

If you ever find yourself in a situation where you want marked text to contain a marker character, [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Emphasis-and-Monospace.html][read the manual page for this situation]].
